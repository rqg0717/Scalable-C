Scalable C has specific properties: 
* It is cheap to create a Scalable C project.
* It is cheap to use, with consistent and obvious APIs.
* It is cheap to deploy, with powerful tools and packagers.
* It is cheap to scale to many cores, with actor-based concurrency.
* It is cheap to scale to many servers, with clustering across a cloud or data center.
* It is cheap to build community, with a modern collaborative process.
